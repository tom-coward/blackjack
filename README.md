# tom-coward/blackjack
This is a straightforward Blackjack (otherwise known as Twenty-One) CLI game, written in Go.

## Assumptions
- The game is a single player vs. the house
- The suit of a card is irrelevant and there are simply 4 unsuited instances of each card (i.e. 4 aces, 4 kings etc.) added to the deck at the beginning
